Activating zooming by moving the slider to the right (it will turn red) will create a second window to the right of the main one with a close-up view of the image. To change the size of the magnified area, use the wheel on a scrolling mouse (or move two fingers vertically on most touchpads). To move the magnified area, pan using the mouse cursor (just one finger on most touchpads).
