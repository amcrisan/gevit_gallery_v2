GEViT Gallery is a practical instantiation of (soon to be published) research exploring the use of data visualization within infectious disease genomic epidemiology. GEViT is an acronym for one part of that research's output and stands for "Genomic Epidemiology Visualization Typology". The GEViT Gallery is implemented in R, with some Java Script plugins and baseline code from the [R Graph Catalog](https://github.com/jennybc/r-graph-catalog) application.

The GEViT gallery is available at http://gevit.net, feel free to add questions and comments about GEViT in the issue page of this repository.
